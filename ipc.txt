============ Pipes ============
Used for communication between same process or interrelated processes ( parent/child )
For two way communication create two pipes.

int pipe( int pipefd[2] );								// pipefd[0] is read end and pipefd[1] is write end
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);	// write to pipefd[1]
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);			// read on pipefd[0]

============ FIFO / Named pipe ============
Used for communicating between two non related processes.
Open fifo file on one end for reading and other end for writing.
For two way communication open in read write.

int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);			// Create file on the filesystem

int open(const char *pathname, int flags);				// Open file and return fd ( O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY )
int close(int fd);										// Close fd
